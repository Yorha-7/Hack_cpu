# Hack_cpu
This is the implementaion of hack cpu by nand 2 tetris course in vivado and basys3 as fpga used for the job
# its a cool programable cpu.
the assembly language is writeen in the program.mem file that is used to execute in rom.
it follows hack architect.
there was a slite change from hack assembly that the logic of 'a' bit is inverted due to human error.
iam hoping to run fibonaci series on this cpu in late future.
# till then 
if anyone wants to use this to practice finding errors and making design more efficient they are good to do so.
i got a lot to learn first before i try testing my skills. till then cya.
